Create models folder and add model and make classes. 

Add the following package 
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

Add dbcontext class with db set properties
Add the connectionstring to the startup class
Set connection string in appsetting.json
Add initial migration with  dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration
dotnet ef database update

Add data annotation and generate another migration and update database
Add migration to seed the database with custom sql in the seed database then update database

To reverse a database migration we make use of the last name of the last run successful migration e.g.
dotnet ef database update AddDataAnnotation

To take back to the latest migration i.e. upgrade it as the last action was down grading the db we make use of the command
dotnet ef database update

Create an empty api controller MakesController and extend ControllerBase
Create a method GetMakes with an IEnumerable ruturn type of make.
Create a contructor and inject the dbcontext as make the dbcontext a private readonly field.

Running the application we have the following error

A possible object cycle was detected which is not supported. This can either be due to a cycle or if the object depth 
is larger than the maximum allowed depth of 32.

We need to make use of DTOs but here we call it Resources. Hence we create a resource folder in the controller and 
create the different resource we want to expose in the resource folder removing the navigation property
Next we make us of a toool called automapper to map the models to the resource. This will enable us not to expose our main
model rather we are exposing the resources.

We make use of the package 
dotnet add package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection

Go to startup class and add 
services.AddAutoMapper(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies());
